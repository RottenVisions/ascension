## What is Ascension?

## Features

  Powerful Event System - Ascension has a built-in event system which automatically distributes the events to the correct receivers. It is highly configurable of course and events can also be targeted at a specific game object or globally. Three delivery modes are available: Unreliable, Unreliable Synced and Reliable.

  Authoritative Movement - Built-in support for input and player controller state synchronization allows easy implementation of custom authoritative movement.

  Both Dedicated and Listen Server - Ascension supports the classic dedicated server and also listen servers where the server is just another player.

  Prioritization & Scoping - Ascension supports both scoping of entities (which entities should a player be aware of) and prioritization of scoped entities (of two entities A and B that are scoped, which one is the most important for a player).

  Hit-box Recording - Ascension has built-in support for recording hit-boxes and rewinding and ray-casting against them, allowing implementation of complex techniques like lag compensation FPS games.

  Synchronized Map Loading - Ascension supports loading maps/scenes from the server, have all the clients load the same map/scene and then provide custom hooks telling the server when the client is ready and vice verse.

  Supports all major unity platforms - Ascension runs on Windows, OSX, iOS, Android, GNU/Linux, and Xbox One. PS4 and Nintendo Switch are being worked on.

	Ascension was developed to support any high paced networking projects Rotten Visions makes, including project DESYSIA.
